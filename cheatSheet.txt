You can specify Vim customizations in the vimrc file. Other than 
appearance changes, you can also re-map any commands. You can open
this file from the command line on MacOS or Linux using:
    vim ~/.vimrc
Or on Windows:
    C:\Users\username\_vimrc

Some useful vimrc settings:
    set number      show line numbers on the left of the screen 
    syntax on       use syntax highlighting
    set autoindent  automatically indent when syntactically appropriate
    set shiftwidth=4
                    use 4 spaces to auto indent
    filetype plugin indent on
                    use different indenting based on the file type 
    set tabstop=4   makes existing tabs 4 spaces wide
    set expandtab   makes new tabs use 4 spaces instead
    set cursorline  highlight the current line
    set ruler       display cursor position in lower right
    mouse=a         use the mouse to move


    
COLORSCHEMES
To install a new colorscheme, copy the colorscheme file into 
the folder (you may have to make it) on MacOS or Linux: 
    ~/.vim/colors/
Or on Windows:
    C:\Users\username\vimfiles

Then add the following line to your vimrc:
    colorscheme filename
